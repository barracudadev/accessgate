# Mainnet Readiness Checklist

What's actually still open before real user funds sit behind these contracts, pulled together
from `SECURITY.md`, `UPGRADE_PATH.md`, `TODO.md`, `BUILD.md`, open issues/discussions, and a
verification pass over the code — not a wishlist, a punch list. Update this as items close; don't
let it drift the way `TODO.md` almost did.

**Last full verification: 2026-09-02** (every claim below was checked against the code, CI config,
GitHub, and the sibling repos on that date). The first revision of this file was written at
commit `451ffcf`; the contract surface has roughly doubled since, so several original items were
stale and have been rewritten or moved to "Closed" at the bottom.

**One-line status:** code readiness has moved a lot, gate readiness has not. No contract is
deployed anywhere with a recorded artifact, the audit has not started and its scope is still
growing, and the signer-removal lockout (#77, verified real) is by recorded decision mitigated
client-side, not on-chain — and that client-side mitigation does not exist yet. The critical path,
in order: tag `audit-v1` on `main` after PR #82 → audit (scope: `AUDIT_SCOPE.md`) → deploy and
record → ship accessgate-mobile#69 before opening to real funds.

---

## 1. Security & Audit — the actual blocker

- [ ] **Settle [#77](https://github.com/3K1-Labs/accessgate/issues/77) in line with the
      recorded #38 decision.** The lockout is real — verified 2026-09-02 against both OZ 0.7.2 and
      `AccessgateSmartAccount` on `main`: OZ's `validate_signers_and_policies` only requires "at least
      one signer *or* one policy", OZ's own test `remove_signer_with_policy_present_success`
      asserts a rule may end up with zero signers, and on Accessgate's account removing the sole signer
      from a rule carrying `spending-limit-policy` succeeds, after which every authorization
      against that rule fails (`UnauthorizedSigner` for the old key, `NotAllowed` with no key).
      But the **decision already on record** (issue #38 / PR #53, 2026-08-27) is that on-chain
      enforcement of signer-change safety is *shelved*: overriding `SmartAccount`'s core trait
      methods is the most sensitive change in the system and repeatedly surfaced adjacent
      bypasses during review, so it stays parked on `experimental` until an external audit, and
      the near-term mitigation is a **client-side confirmation warning**, with the "only protects
      callers using Accessgate's own UI" limitation explicitly accepted. #77 (filed 2026-08-31, after
      that decision) asks for a new on-chain check in a `remove_signer_checked` that doesn't exist
      on `main`, and a contributor volunteered on 2026-09-01. Actions:
      - [x] Rescope #77 to match the decision — done 2026-09-02: status comment, retitled,
        relabelled `blocked`/`documentation`, `help wanted` removed, volunteer redirected.
      - [x] File the UI warning itself — done 2026-09-02 as
        [accessgate-mobile#69](https://github.com/3K1-Labs/accessgate-mobile/issues/69), cross-linked from
        [accessgate-mobile#68](https://github.com/3K1-Labs/accessgate-mobile/issues/68) (real on-chain
        removal, currently a local-state mock). `accessgate-web-extension` has no removal flow at all,
        so nothing to file there yet; its self-management UI issue (#42) inherits this when it
        starts. Net today: Accessgate's own clients can't remove signers on-chain, so exposure is
        limited to direct contract callers — but **accessgate-mobile#69 must ship before mainnet**;
        it is the accepted mitigation.
      - [x] Audit scope vs PR #53 — decided 2026-09-02: the audit covers `main` as-is; PR #53
        stays on `experimental` until after launch. `AUDIT_SCOPE.md` asks the auditor whether OZ
        has a contract-level answer since. Post-launch, `experimental` should be reset to `main`
        and #53's commit (`4711290`) cherry-picked back: a dry run shows conflicts only in
        `accessgate-smart-account/src/lib.rs` and `src/test.rs` (both #53 and #71 define
        `AccessgateSmartAccountError`).
- [x] **Freeze the audit / v1 deploy scope — decided 2026-09-02.** Scope is *everything on
      `main`* as it stands, written up in [`AUDIT_SCOPE.md`](AUDIT_SCOPE.md). Remaining
      mechanics: tag `audit-v1` on `main` once PR #82 merges, and hold the four open PRs (#81
      recurring-escrow, #72 inheritance-vault, #55 timelock-policy, #52 rate-limit-policy) until
      the audit report is in — they add new contracts, so merging them mid-audit widens the
      target. Nothing else lands on `main` before the report except audit-finding fixes.
- [ ] **External security audit of Accessgate's own code.** `SECURITY.md` says this plainly: *"This
      project has not yet undergone an external security audit... do not deploy it to hold real
      value without your own independent review."* Nothing else on this list matters if this box
      stays unchecked. Scope distinction: OpenZeppelin's `stellar-accounts`/`stellar-contract-utils`
      /`stellar-fee-abstraction`/`stellar-access` (pinned `=0.7.2`, the latest stable as of this
      revision; `0.8.0-rc.3` exists as a pre-release) went through OZ's own `v0.7.0` audit. The gap
      is **Accessgate's own code on top**: `accessgate-smart-account` (`upgrade()` and `deploy_contract`
      wiring), `factory-contract`, every `accessgate-verifiers/*` and `policies/*` crate, and
      `fee-forwarder`'s role gating. `SECURITY.md`'s Scope section now lists the full set.
- [ ] **Revisit the bug-bounty question.** Deferred in `TODO.md` "in favor of a plain email
      contact for now; reconsider closer to mainnet launch" — this is that moment.
- [ ] **Update `SECURITY.md`'s "Status" section** once the audit above actually happens — it's
      explicitly written to be revisited, not a permanent statement.
- [ ] **Cross-repo trust context, not this repo's bug, but relevant before real funds are at
      stake anywhere in the system**: the confirmed fund-loss incident on `accessgate-mobile` (logout
      destroying an unbacked-up wallet with no warning — private advisory `GHSA-gcg8-6536-rvc3`)
      is **still in `draft` state as of 2026-09-02**. The contracts can be flawless and users can
      still lose funds through a client bug. Confirm client-side security posture before calling
      the *system* mainnet-ready, not just this repo.

## 2. Deployment — nothing is deployed or recorded yet

`BUILD.md` was reset in #67 and `deployments/` is empty: **there is no recorded deployment of any
contract on any network.** Every item here is a first deploy under the artifact-archiving
discipline `deployments/README.md` describes, not a "redeploy" of something stale.

- [ ] **Deploy and record every singleton in the frozen v1 set**, with `BUILD.md` entries pointing
      at archived artifacts in `deployments/artifacts/`. The current full set is 4 verifiers
      (`ed25519`, `p256`, `secp256k1`, `webauthn`), 7 policies, `fee-forwarder`, the
      `accessgate-smart-account` wasm upload, and the factory — trimmed to whatever section 1's scope
      freeze decides.
- [ ] **Account Factory.** Code verified 2026-09-02: 4-arg constructor
      (`smart_account_wasm_hash`, `ed25519_verifier`, `webauthn_verifier`, `threshold_policy`),
      salt preimage `accessgate.factory.account.v2`, instance TTL 1,555,200 ledgers (~90 days). Deploy
      after its four inputs exist.
- [ ] **Ed25519 verifier — confirm the clients.** The Phantom-popup variant now lives in
      `demo/modified-ed25519-verifier` with a "do not deploy" module doc, and the README's
      deployment order uses the plain `ed25519-verifier`, so the *contract-side* decision is made.
      Still unverified from this repo: that every real client signer (web-extension passkey path,
      mobile passkey path, any raw-Ed25519 SDK path) works against the plain verifier's raw
      32-byte hash. Check before deploy, not after.
- [ ] **Deployer identity operational security.** The factory has deliberately no admin key
      (`UPGRADE_PATH.md` Decision 1), but *something* signs the mainnet deployment transactions.
      Confirm who holds that key and how it's secured — a compromised deployer during initial
      rollout is a real, if narrow, window even though the deployed factory has no ongoing
      privileged function.
- [ ] **`fee-forwarder` key custody — new since the original checklist.** Unlike everything else in
      the lineup, `fee-forwarder` has live privileged roles on mainnet: `admin`, `manager`, and
      the `executor` set (`accessgate-relayer`'s operating addresses), with `grant_role`/`revoke_role`
      available after deploy. Decide who holds `admin` and `manager` (hardware key? multisig?
      an Accessgate smart account?), document it, and make sure the relayer's executor key rotation
      story exists before it's needed.

## 3. Signer / verifier scope — decided 2026-09-02

v1 ships all four verifiers as deployed singletons. The factory creates accounts with `Ed25519`
or `WebAuthn` signers only; raw P-256 and secp256k1 keys are attached after creation through the
account's own signer management. secp256k1 has no validated wallet flow and that is accepted.
Recorded as "known and accepted" in `AUDIT_SCOPE.md`. Not blockers, still worth doing:

- [ ] **Raw P-256 session-key follow-ups** — [#22](https://github.com/3K1-Labs/accessgate/issues/22)
      (end-to-end session authorization coverage) and [#23](https://github.com/3K1-Labs/accessgate/issues/23)
      (lifecycle and threat-model docs). #23 in particular would help the auditor; neither
      changes contract code.

## 4. Architecture decisions still genuinely open

- [ ] **Guardian/account recovery — completely unresolved.**
      [Discussion #31](https://github.com/3K1-Labs/accessgate/discussions/31) is open with
      zero comments. Open design questions on whether this is a `Policy` or needs a new
      account-level primitive. The mobile incident above *and* #77 are both exactly the scenario
      recovery would address — prioritize before mainnet, not treat as a nice-to-have.
- [ ] **Storage migration strategy** for a future breaking `AccessgateSmartAccount` change —
      `UPGRADE_PATH.md`'s "Still open" section: not decided which of eager/lazy/enum-wrapper
      migration fits, since no breaking change exists yet to migrate. Fine to stay undecided
      until a real breaking change is proposed, but worth knowing this is unresolved going into
      mainnet, not forgotten.
- [ ] **Client-side upgrade-availability UX** (web extension / mobile / dApp) — nothing surfaces
      "a new account version is available" to a user today. Low urgency until the first real
      `upgrade()` ships, but should exist before it's needed in production.
- [ ] **No test proves `upgrade()` changes behavior.** `accessgate-smart-account/src/test.rs` still
      only upgrades the account to its own current wasm — proves the mechanism and the self-auth
      gate, not a behavior change. Needs a second compiled fixture to upgrade *to*.
- [ ] **Confidential token wallet support** —
      [Discussion #34](https://github.com/3K1-Labs/accessgate/discussions/34), zero comments.
      Not a mainnet-*launch* blocker (a follow-on capability, not core wallet function), but it
      has its own external timeline risk (confidential tokens themselves were still in audit as
      of last check) independent of anything in this repo.

## 5. CI / test hardening

- [ ] **Three wrapper crates have no tests of their own** — `threshold-policy`,
      `weighted-threshold-policy`, `spending-limit-policy`. Spending-limit is exercised through
      `accessgate-smart-account`'s tests; the two threshold crates are exercised nowhere in the
      workspace. Cheap to add (PR #53 on `experimental` already has tests for both threshold
      crates that could be lifted without the enforcement code). Disclosed in `AUDIT_SCOPE.md`.
- [ ] **No enforced test coverage threshold** (OZ uses `cargo llvm-cov --fail-under-lines 90`; we
      have nothing equivalent). Decide whether to adopt one before or shortly after mainnet.
- [ ] **No dependency audit in CI** — no `cargo-deny` or `cargo-audit` config exists. Cheap to add;
      worth having before the audit so the auditor isn't the one who finds a yanked crate.
- [ ] **Resource-cost regression report** —
      [#70](https://github.com/3K1-Labs/accessgate/issues/70), open. Not a launch gate, but
      the kind of thing that's much easier to add before the first mainnet fee complaint.
- [ ] **`emit_*` event helper retrofit** for `session-policy` and `factory-contract` — the newer
      crates (`recipient-allowlist-policy`, `parameter-scoped-policy`, `vesting-schedule`) already
      use the helper pattern; the factory still publishes inline. Style consistency, not a bug,
      low urgency.

## 6. Cross-repo gaps

Not blockers for *this* repo's mainnet deploy, but they affect the system's overall readiness.
Verified against the GitHub remotes 2026-09-02:

- [ ] **`accessgate-api`** — none of `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, or
      `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` exist on the remote. See `OSS_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md`.
- [ ] **`accessgate-relayer`** — has `SECURITY.md` only; missing `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
      `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
- [ ] **`accessgate-dapp`'s repository location is still unverified.**
      `3K1-Labs/accessgate-dapp` doesn't resolve, and the local clone has no git remote and a
      single "initial commit". (The local copy *does* have all four governance files.) Track down
      where this lives — or create it — if it ships alongside mainnet.

---

## Closed since the previous revision

Kept so nobody re-investigates them:

- **CI now verifies the WASM build** (2026-09-02). `rust.yml` gained a `wasm-build` job running
  `stellar contract build` over the whole workspace. The feared OZ same-name-function collision
  doesn't apply: stellar-cli builds each member as a separate `cargo rustc --manifest-path`
  invocation. Verified across all 19 crates before adding.
- **`SECURITY.md` Scope section** updated (2026-09-02) to list every current crate, including
  `fee-forwarder` and `templates/*`.
- **Ed25519 demo-vs-production split** — resolved in code (#33): the wrapped variant is in `demo/`
  and documented as not for deployment. Only the client-compatibility confirmation remains (§2).
- **"Secp256k1 — in or out?"** in its original form — the stub was deleted (#33) and then a real
  stateless verifier was added (#79). The live question is now the scope decision in §3.
- **"Everything on testnet is stale"** — superseded by the `BUILD.md` reset (#67). There is no
  testnet record to be stale anymore; §2 is a clean-slate deploy list.
- **`accessgate-web-extension` dead Phantom/Freighter code** —
  [issue #28](https://github.com/3K1-Labs/accessgate-web-extension/issues/28) is closed.

## Not on this list on purpose

- Confidential tokens (tracked in Discussion #34 — a roadmap item, not a launch gate).
- New verifier kinds beyond the four shipped (BLS, RSA, ZK-based signing, email) — deferred per
  `VERIFIER_USE_CASE_RESEARCH.md`'s own recommendation; revisit post-launch unless a concrete
  need appears.
- The open template/policy PRs (#81, #72, #55, #52) as individual items — they're covered by the
  scope-freeze decision in §1.
