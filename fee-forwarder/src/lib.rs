//! Permissioned fee forwarder — lets `accessgate-relayer` sponsor gasless
//! transactions for Accessgate accounts that hold no XLM.
//!
//! Singleton, permissioned contract shared across every Accessgate account, same
//! pattern as `ed25519-verifier`/`threshold-policy` (not deployed per
//! account). Permissioned because Accessgate controls both sides of the flow —
//! the wallet and the relayer — so the executor role is reserved for
//! `accessgate-relayer`'s own operating address(es), not an open relayer market.
//!
//! This is a thin `#[contract]` wrapper around OZ's `stellar-fee-abstraction`
//! helpers (`stellar_fee_abstraction::collect_fee_and_invoke` and friends) —
//! all real fee-collection logic lives upstream, this crate only supplies the
//! deployable contract shell plus the role-gating that makes the flow
//! permissioned. Follows OZ's `examples/fee-forwarder-permissioned` reference
//! contract.
//!
//! # How it works
//!
//! - `__constructor(admin, manager, executors)` — sets `admin`, grants
//!   `manager` the `manager` role, and grants each address in `executors` the
//!   `executor` role. `AccessControl` (below) exposes `grant_role`/
//!   `revoke_role` for admin/manager-authorized follow-up changes to either
//!   role after deployment.
//! - `forward` — the sponsored-transaction entrypoint. The account signs one
//!   authorization tree covering `forward()`, with sub-invocations for
//!   `fee_token.approve(fee_forwarder, max_fee_amount, expiration_ledger)` (if
//!   needed) and the actual target call. The relayer, gated to the `executor`
//!   role by `#[only_role]`, fills in the real `fee_amount` (must be `<=
//!   max_fee_amount`) and submits, paying the network's XLM fee itself.
//!   Requires **both** the user's and the executor's authorization — collects
//!   the fee and forwards the target call atomically: if either step fails, the
//!   whole transaction (including the fee collection) reverts.
//! - `enable_fee_token` / `disable_fee_token` — manager-gated allowlist
//!   management for which tokens `forward` accepts as a fee. The allowlist is
//!   disabled (all tokens accepted) until the first token is enabled — see
//!   `stellar_fee_abstraction::is_allowed_fee_token`.
//! - `sweep_tokens` — manager-gated withdrawal of fees this contract has
//!   collected.
//!
//! # Security Warning
//!
//! `collect_fee_and_invoke` only authorizes the user's *input* — it does not
//! vet whether the forwarded call is safe for the user to make. Simulating
//! the outcome of `target_contract.target_fn(target_args)` before signing is
//! the invoker's (the account's own signer's) responsibility, same as any
//! other authorization the account signs.
