//! Demo/reference crate — **not part of the shipped verifier lineup.**
//!
//! This was built to prove, in a one-off demo, that a Phantom-held Ed25519
//! key could deploy and become the owning signer of an Accessgate smart account
//! on-chain. It isn't wired into any product surface: Accessgate and Phantom are
//! separate browser extensions, and nothing gives Accessgate's extension an
//! ongoing way to drive Phantom's signing popup after that initial demo
//! transaction — that would require real extension-to-extension
//! integration that was never built. The strategy going forward is Accessgate
//! as the wallet (its own extension + mobile app), with other wallets
//! integrating *via SDK*, not by Accessgate reaching into their signing UI.
//!
//! Kept here, out of `accessgate-verifiers/`, purely as a worked reference: the
//! wrapping pattern below (hex-encode the hash, prepend a human-readable
//! prefix, verify against the wrapped message) is the general shape needed
//! any time a *specific* wallet's signing popup refuses to sign a raw
//! 32-byte payload — the same problem `secp256k1-verifier-spec.md` flags
//! as a possible future need if a real MetaMask-popup integration is ever
//! attempted. Do not deploy this contract or treat it as a real verifier.
//!
//! # Why the underlying constraint exists (kept for reference)
//!
//! Phantom's browser-extension `signMessage` popup is a generic,
//! untrusted-dApp-facing API — it can't tell "a legitimate 32-byte auth
//! hash" from "a malicious site trying to get you to blind-sign an opaque
//! payload that's actually a transaction." As a defensive heuristic,
//! Phantom refuses to sign raw 32-byte payloads at all (they're
//! indistinguishable from Solana transaction hashes). The workaround: wrap
//! the hash in a human-readable message before asking Phantom to sign it —
//! `AUTH_PREFIX + lowercase_hex(auth_payload_hash)` — and this contract
//! reconstructs that exact 92-byte message and verifies the signature
//! against it.
