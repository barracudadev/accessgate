//! Rolling-window spending limit policy for Accessgate smart accounts.
//!
//! Attach this policy to a `CallContract` context rule to cap how much can
//! be transferred through that contract within a rolling ledger window —
//! e.g. "at most 10 XLM per rolling day" out of a specific token contract.
//! Once the limit is hit, further transfers in that window are rejected
//! until old entries age out.
//!
//! This is a thin `#[contract]` wrapper around OZ's `spending_limit` policy
//! (`stellar_accounts::policies::spending_limit`) — all real logic lives
//! upstream, this crate only supplies the deployable contract shell the
//! factory and smart accounts can actually install and call.
//!
//! # How it works
//!
//! - `install` — called once per `(smart_account, context_rule)` pair, with a
//!   `spending_limit` (max total, in stroops) and `period_ledgers` (the rolling
//!   window size). Rejects a non-`CallContract` context rule, or a non-positive
//!   limit/period.
//! - `enforce` — called on every authorized call against the rule; evicts
//!   spending entries older than `period_ledgers`, sums what remains, and
//!   panics if adding this call's amount would exceed `spending_limit`.
//!   Otherwise records the entry and updates the running total.
//! - `set_spending_limit` / `get_spending_limit_data` — read or change the
//!   stored limit (and inspect spend history) after installation.
//! - `uninstall` — removes all stored spending history and the limit.
//!
//! # Important Constraints
//!
//! - **Only intercepts calls literally named `transfer`**, with the amount read
//!   as the *third* positional argument — the standard SEP-41 token
//!   `transfer(from, to, amount)` shape. Any other function call on the rule is
//!   unconditionally rejected, not silently allowed through.
//! - **One contract per installation.** Requiring a `CallContract` context rule
//!   pins each installed policy to a single target contract, so all tracked
//!   transfers share one denomination. Limiting spend across several different
//!   token contracts needs a separate context rule (and policy install) per
//!   contract.
//! - **Spend history is capped** at `MAX_HISTORY_ENTRIES` (1000) entries per
//!   `(smart_account, context_rule)`; exceeding it panics with
//!   `HistoryCapacityExceeded` rather than silently dropping old data.
