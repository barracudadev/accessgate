//! Simple (unweighted) M-of-N threshold policy for Accessgate smart accounts.
//!
//! Attach this policy to a context rule to require that at least `threshold`
//! of its signers authenticate before an action is authorized — a standard
//! M-of-N multisig, with every signer counting equally (contrast with
//! `weighted-threshold-policy`, where some signers can outweigh others).
//!
//! This is a thin `#[contract]` wrapper around OZ's `simple_threshold` policy
//! (`stellar_accounts::policies::simple_threshold`) — all real logic lives
//! upstream, this crate only supplies the deployable contract shell the
//! factory and smart accounts can actually install and call.
//!
//! # How it works
//!
//! - `install` — called once per `(smart_account, context_rule)` pair, with a
//!   `threshold` (the number of signers required). Rejects `threshold == 0` or
//!   `threshold > ` the rule's current signer count.
//! - `enforce` — called during authorization; counts how many of the rule's
//!   signers actually authenticated for this call, and panics unless that count
//!   is `>= threshold`.
//! - `set_threshold` / `get_threshold` — read or change the stored threshold
//!   after installation.
//! - `uninstall` — removes the stored threshold entirely.
//!
//! # Security Warning: Signer Set Divergence
//!
//! The threshold is validated against the signer count only at install time.
//! It is **not automatically updated** when signers are later added to or
//! removed from the account's `ContextRule`. Left unattended, this causes:
//!
//! - **DoS**: removing signers can drop the count below the stored threshold,
//!   permanently blocking any action this policy governs until the threshold is
//!   lowered.
//! - **Silent security degradation**: adding signers without raising the
//!   threshold quietly turns a strict N-of-N into a weaker N-of-(N+M).
//!
//! Whoever administers signer changes on an account using this policy
//! **must** call `set_threshold` in the same transaction — before removing
//! signers, or after adding them. See OZ's `simple_threshold` module docs
//! for the full writeup and worked examples.
