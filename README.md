# Accessgate

## Overview

Soroban smart contracts for the Accessgate auth layer. Provides deterministic smart account creation with support for Ed25519, raw P-256, raw secp256k1, and WebAuthn signers.

Accessgate accounts are Soroban smart accounts — programmable wallets that replace private-key-only authorization with flexible multi-signer, multi-policy authorization. Users can sign transactions with Ed25519 keys, raw P-256 keys, raw secp256k1 keys, passkeys, or any supported combination. Wallet-specific signing flows require separate client integration.

The system is built on the [OpenZeppelin Stellar Contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts) smart account framework.

## Repository Structure

This repository is a **single Cargo workspace** — every contract is a member crate, sharing one
`Cargo.lock` and one pinned `stellar-accounts` version, built/tested independently via
`--package`.

## Contracts

### Factory — `account-factory/` ✅

The canonical entrypoint for creating Accessgate smart accounts. Validates and canonicalizes signer inputs, derives deterministic account addresses, and deploys new smart account instances.

**Key properties:**
- Address derivation is deterministic — same params always produce the same address
- Signer input order does not affect the derived address (canonical sort applied)
- Idempotent — calling `create_account` twice with the same params returns the existing account
- The same signer set can own multiple accounts via an explicit `account_salt`
- Verifier and policy contracts are pre-deployed and passed in at factory construction — the factory only ever deploys smart account instances

See [`account-factory/README.md`](account-factory/README.md) for full documentation.

### Smart Account — `accessgate-smart-account/` ✅

OZ-based programmable wallet contract. Implements `CustomAccountInterface`, `SmartAccount`, `ExecutionEntryPoint`, and `Upgradeable`. Initialized with a set of signers and optional policies by the factory. `upgrade()` is self-authorized — gated by the account's own signers via `require_auth()`, the same as every other mutation, not an external admin. See [`docs/UPGRADE_PATH.md`](docs/UPGRADE_PATH.md) for the reasoning.

### Verifiers — `accessgate-verifiers/` ✅

Stateless singleton contracts that verify signatures on behalf of smart accounts. One contract per signer kind, shared across all accounts on the network.

| Contract | Signer type | Key format | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ed25519-verifier` | Any Ed25519 signer — native keys, SDK-integrated wallets | 32-byte Ed25519 public key | ✅ Implemented |
| `p256-verifier` | Raw P-256 session or external signers | 65-byte uncompressed SEC1 P-256 key | ✅ Implemented |
| `secp256k1-verifier` | Raw secp256k1 external signers | 65-byte uncompressed SEC1 secp256k1 key | ✅ Verifier implemented; wallet integration unvalidated |
| `webauthn-verifier` | Passkeys, Face ID, Touch ID, YubiKey | 65-byte P-256 key + credential ID | ✅ Implemented |

`secp256k1-verifier` checks a low-S `r[32] || s[32] || recovery_id[1]`
signature over the raw Accessgate auth digest. The recovery ID must be raw `0` or
`1`; clients receiving Ethereum-style `27`/`28` values must normalize them
off-chain. This does not provide EIP-191, `personal_sign`, or automatic MetaMask
compatibility.

### Threshold Policy — `policies/threshold-policy/` ✅

OZ simple threshold policy. Enforces M-of-N authorization for multisig accounts, all signers weighted equally. Deployed as a singleton shared across all multisig accounts, and the one the factory installs automatically for multi-signer accounts (see `AccountInitParams.threshold`).

### Weighted Threshold Policy — `policies/weighted-threshold-policy/` ✅

OZ weighted threshold policy — each signer gets an individual weight, and a minimum total weight is required for authorization (e.g. CEO=100, CTO=75, CFO=75, threshold=150). Not wired into the factory's automatic multisig install — install it on an existing account with `add_policy` when equal-weight M-of-N isn't the right shape. **Carries the same signer-set-divergence footgun as the simple threshold policy** (see the crate's module doc): weights and threshold are frozen at install time and must be updated manually via `set_signer_weight`/`set_threshold` whenever the signer set changes, or authorization can silently weaken or permanently lock.

### Session Policy — `policies/session-policy/` ✅

Restricts a context rule's signers to an allow-listed set of contract function names — the building block behind Accessgate session keys. Own logic, not a wrapper around an OZ primitive.

### Spending Limit Policy — `policies/spending-limit-policy/` ✅

Thin wrapper around OZ's `stellar-accounts` spending-limit policy. Enforces a rolling spend cap per context rule.

### Fee Forwarder — `fee-forwarder/` ✅

Singleton, permissioned contract that lets `accessgate-relayer` sponsor gasless transactions for Accessgate accounts holding no XLM. Thin wrapper around OZ's `stellar-fee-abstraction` helpers, following OZ's `examples/fee-forwarder-permissioned` reference. An account signs one authorization tree covering `forward()`, with sub-invocations for the fee-token `approve` and the actual target call; the relayer (gated to the `executor` role) fills in the real `fee_amount` (`<=` the user's signed cap) and submits, paying the network's XLM fee itself. The contract collects the fee and forwards the target call atomically — either both succeed or the whole transaction reverts. `enable_fee_token`/`disable_fee_token`/`sweep_tokens` are manager-gated. Off-chain quoting, holding the executor credential, and submitting `forward()` transactions are out of scope here — tracked in the companion `accessgate-relayer` issue.

### Demo — `demo/` ⚠️

Not part of the shipped contract lineup — not deployed for real use, not wired into anything. `modified-ed25519-verifier` was built to prove a one-off demo (a Phantom-held key deploying and owning an Accessgate smart account on-chain), not a real product feature: Accessgate and Phantom are separate browser extensions, and nothing gives Accessgate's own extension an ongoing way to drive Phantom's signing popup afterward. Kept as a worked reference for the general "wallet popup won't sign a raw hash" wrapping pattern — see its module doc.

## Deployment Order

Before a factory can be deployed, all singleton contracts must already exist on the network. The required order is:

```
1. stellar contract install   # upload smart account wasm, capture hash
2. stellar contract deploy    ed25519-verifier
3. stellar contract deploy    webauthn-verifier
4. stellar contract deploy    threshold-policy
5. stellar contract deploy    factory  (pass smart_account_wasm_hash + 3 addresses)
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Stellar CLI (v25.2.0+)
cargo install --locked stellar-cli
```

### Build and test

`cargo +nightly fmt --all -- --check` formats/checks the whole workspace regardless of where you
run it from. Everything else scopes to one crate at a time — either `cd` into the crate directory
or pass `--package <name>` from the repo root (package names don't always match directory names,
e.g. `accessgate-smart-account`'s package is `smart-account` — see each crate's own `Cargo.toml`):

```bash
cargo +nightly fmt --all -- --check                          # whole workspace

cd accessgate-smart-account   # or any other crate listed above
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings     # lint, this crate only
cargo test                                                   # unit + integration tests
stellar contract build                                       # WASM build
```
